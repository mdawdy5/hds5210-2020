    "We had two major areas of discussion this week.  The first was all about how to work with string data - parsing and splitting strings using basic string fuctions as well as more complex string matching using regular expressions.  The second was a basic introduction to Pandas with a few different examples of how to load data into Pandas and then visualize it using graphs (histogram, distribution, scatter, bar, timeseries).\n",
